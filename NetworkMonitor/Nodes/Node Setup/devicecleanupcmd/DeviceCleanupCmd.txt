Freeware by Uwe Sieber (c) 2007-2017

-t  test only
-s  skip creation of a system restore point
-n  no wait for key press when finished
-m  minimum age of devices to remove

patterns are device IDs, device classes or friendly names. Wildcards can be used.

Samples:

Test mode (shows which devices would be removed)
DeviceCleanupCmd * -t


The device's 'age' time comes from the write time of the device's registry key
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum

On some Windows the times are set on startup or recurring for no obvious reason,
so all devices seem to have the same age. On most Windows the time is set when
the device gets active.

Non-PnP devices and 'soft' devices are not deleted because they are not automatically
reinstalled. These are devices whose ID begins with
- HTREE\ROOT\
- ROOT\
- SW\{

If you want to delete them, use the Windows Device Manager.


Under x64 edtitions of Windows only the x64 version works.

Administrator previleges are required for cleanup.

A GUI version is available too:
